					<li class="values__item">
						<h4 class="title values__item-title">Trustworthy cooperation</h4>
						We rely on long-term cooperation and partnerships with both our
						clients and our translators and other service providers, which are
						characterised by reliability, competence, adherence to deadlines and
						discretion. Without trust, partnerships cannot be developed in the
						long term and turned into successful projects for all parties.
					</li>
					<li class="values__item">
						<h4 class="title values__item-title">Understanding & accuracy</h4>
						Localising a text correctly requires an understanding of culture and
						language, experience in the relevant field and skill in application.
						To put ourselves in the client's shoes, we go the extra mile and
						sometimes find alternative ways to get there through our advice.
					</li>
					<li class="values__item">
						<h4 class="title values__item-title">
							Not only correct, but to the point
						</h4>
						No two people are alike. It is the same with written text. A
						translation may be correct, but does it reflect the author's
						intention? It is a question of understanding what exactly is meant
						and how the intention can best be conveyed in the target language.
					</li>
					<li class="values__item">
						<h4 class="title values__item-title">Individuality</h4>
						As a family business, we allow ourselves to interact with our
						clients on an individual basis and to respond to their multifaceted
						needs and issues, whether by phone, email, chat or in person. Our
						clients deal with real people. We enjoy a lively exchange with them.
					</li>
					<li class="values__item">
						<h4 class="title values__item-title">
							International & cosmopolitan
						</h4>
						We live internationality. Our team comprises 5 nations with
						different mother tongues. Our work allows us to be mobile and so we
						can experience and unite languages, cultures and diversity at our
						respective locations.
