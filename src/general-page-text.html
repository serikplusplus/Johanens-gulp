							<h2>A convincing marketing translation</h2>
							<p>
								A translation of a marketing or commercial text by one of our
								translators does exactly what it's supposed to do: win over your
								readers. We don't just translate a text word for word. Marketing
								translations require a fair amount of liberties to be taken in
								order to meet the needs and desires of your target audience
								abroad. While translating marketing texts, our translators may
								consult you about any cultural differences that need to be taken
								into account. As far as content goes, your translation will of
								course be identical to the source text, unless the briefing
								states otherwise. We are also experienced in providing SEO
								translations.
